abstract = {We report free-standing atomic crystals that are strictly 2D and can be viewed as individual atomic planes pulled out of bulk crystals or as unrolled single-wall nanotubes. By using micromechanical cleavage, we have prepared and studied a variety of 2D crystals including single layers of boron nitride, graphite, several dichalcogenides, and complex oxides. These atomically thin sheets (essentially gigantic 2D molecules unprotected from the immediate environment) are stable under ambient conditions, exhibit high crystal quality, and are continuous on a macroscopic scale.},

abstract = {We describe monocrystalline graphitic films, which are a few atoms thick but are nonetheless stable under ambient conditions, metallic, and of remarkably high quality. The films are found to be a two-dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands, and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 10(13) per square centimeter and with room-temperature mobilities of approximately 10,000 square centimeters per volt-second can be induced by applying gate voltage.},

abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and$\backslash$ncondensed matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits$\backslash$nexceptionally high crystal and electronic quality and, despite its short$\backslash$nhistory, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential$\backslash$napplications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of$\backslash$nthe realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no$\backslash$nlonger requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental$\backslash$nphysics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the$\backslash$nemergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed matter physics, where$\backslash$nquantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high energy$\backslash$nphysics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More$\backslash$ngenerally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are$\backslash$nonly one atom thick and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional$\backslash$nphysics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile$\backslash$nground for applications.},
